📦 Project X: AI-Driven Strategic Analysis for Industrial 3D Printing
🧠 Overview
This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven roadmap for transitioning Project X, a startup in 3D printing, from prosumer-grade tools to industrial-grade polymer-based additive manufacturing. It integrates predictive analytics, machine learning, and financial modeling to assist in selecting the right equipment, managing cost structures, and ensuring operational excellence with AI.

🧪 Key Analyses
1. 🧱 Industrial 3D Printing Technology Assessment
Compared EOS P 500, P 770, and P 3 NEXT systems

Evaluated build volumes, laser speeds, power consumption, and dimensions

Identified suitable use cases based on material properties and technical fit

2. 💰 Financial Benchmarking & Cost Analysis
Simulated CAPEX and OPEX for equipment

Projected ROI, NPV, and break-even timelines

Included dynamic cost structures and visualized key financial metrics

3. 🤖 AI-Based Operational Analytics
Defect Prediction using sensor features (temperature, vibration, etc.)

Predictive Maintenance using regression models to predict failure days

Job Scheduling Optimization to improve machine utilization rates
